 Ah, springtime in Houston! It's no secret that this time of year brings some unique challenges when you suffer from asthma like me. The warmer temperatures and increased humidity make it difficult enough, but throw in some pollen and other allergens, and suddenly my daily routine becomes much more complicated. As I sit here typing away at work (because hey, gotta keep those bills paid), I find myself constantly reaching for my trusty Pulmacort flexihlar and albuteral just to try and stay ahead of these pesky symptoms creeping up on me throughout each afternoon . I know full well what happens come summer months when everything seems to go into hyperdrive; plants start blooming left right center resulting even higher levels particles floating through our beloved atmosphere (I say affectionately because let be real---air quality isn't exactly topnotch anymore). And don't get me started upon windy days or colds comingling together creating perfect storm Of congestion chaos inside lungs... How do we manage? Its simple really - take precautions early doors before things escaluate too far out hand.. For instance during peak seasons i ensure myself extra dosages medications ,avoid strenuous activities after heavy exercise sessions( unless absolutely necessary) amongst others keeping tabs close friends family members monitoring conditions closely so everyone stays safe healthy possible under current circumstances - because lets face truthfully fol

 Title: How My Chronic Illness Has Changed Over Time Last month marked three years since my diagnosis date, as I was first told that "You've got asthma." Three whole years! Can you believe it? It feels like just yesterday I was learning how to properly administer my medications (Pulmicort Flexhaler and Albuterol) and trying everything under the sun to manage my symptoms effectively enough so they wouldn't interfere too much with everyday living; yet here we are now – still battling this thing called asthma together). As an adult experiencing chronic ill health problems at such young age has taught me some tough lessons early on - patience being number one among them given its constant battle between us all each passing day despite taking necessary precautions & treatments prescribed by physicians & doctors visits every few months keeping tabs open regarding improvement(or lack thereof sometimes.) One thing remains unchanged though—the frustration level when dealing issues related directly or indirectly towards condition including having limitations set upon normal activities due times restrictions imposed because certain situations aren't suitable environmentally speaking especially during periods extreme heat/colds forcing self adjust accordingly within comfort parameters established through trial&error methods until finding what works best personal circumstances any changes happening anywhere else inside body would lead straight back door hospital emergency room should worst occur! Another hard truth realized lately involves tolerance

 As we continue into springtime here in Houston, I must say that my asthma has been behaving itself quite well this past month! It's amaze ing how much better things can be when you take care of yourself properly. Speaking as someone who's had asthma since childhood ,I know firsthand just how frustrating those sudden bouts of coughing or gasping for breath an d can feel like they seamingly never end . But let me tell y our readers –it doesn't always have tpbe th i s way! With some conscious adjustments t o lifestyle along wi th persistence treatment plans from doctor visits too medications such as albut erol & pulmicort flex halers (used daily), one ca n significantly reduce their occurrence s Of course there may still bei occasional flare ups triggered say a bout o excessive exercise duration(more t han forty five minutes per session) extreme temperatures, or even contact allergies ! yet thanks too careful precautions taken before hand plus having emergency medici ne close at hand during workout sessions helps minimize risks immensely! So yes folks out ther e living wit ha stha...

June has been an exciting month for me as far my battle against Asthma is concerned! It's fascinating because while some things seem to be getting worse - like those long bouts of coughing at nighttime - other things appear better almost every single week I feel less constricted when i take deep breathes . And you know what that means? My daily walks could become longer (just under 45 min) without feeling too much discomfort now - before this could only last half hour top ! That alone make june worth celebrating but there were couple new developments happened during these past four weeks : three times already ,my albuterol wasn’t working quite right so we tried another brand name version called Ventolin HFA . Soon enough though same old familiar sensations came rushing back just moments after using either one ,making both look equally unhelpful really sad face emojis all round till something worked again😔 any way soon found ourselves reaching deeper into pharmacy bag pulling out yet another option – this was Neulasta shot . It took us multiple tries due course of nebulizer treatments each varying dosages amounts prior finding sweet spot where nothing seemed get better faster however little bit side effects emerged such puffy cheeks swelling lips faces etc... We didn't mind tho coz meant relief from constant breathless state mine had plagued since January began

 Title – "How My Asthma Symptoms Have Changed Over Time" As I reflect back on this past months' experiences living with my asthma, there has been some pretty significant changes that come to mind. First off let me tell you; those summer days here in Houston aren't all they cracked up to be when you suffer from severe respiratory issues like mine! The heat index hovers at an oppressive degree just perfect enough so even moderating indoor activities becomes problematic without being too taxing given what little energy reserves remain after navigating such sweltering temperatures during these hot summers nighttime brings new challenges as humidity levels rise alongside temperature - making things particularly tough especially if one isn’t equipped appropriately (like myself); additionally adding extra layers onto already existing struggles experienced through normal daily operations involving basic tasks requiring additional effort simply because our bodies work twice times slower due extreme dehumidification efforts put forth solely out necessity rather pleasure)...But wait; we weren't done yet folks...we haven't entered full blown hurricane season just quite yethere! Oh boy does mother nature knows ways of keeping us entertained via constant threatens(some real ones), occasional heavy rainfalls followed closely behind by unrelenting wind gusts; needless say - these lovelies tends keep both me along well wishes ever vig

 As I sit here thinking of what has happened this past month, all I could think was if only my lungs were as reliable as my work schedule at Hewitt Mechanical Engineering Company! It's the last week of summer vacation; we are right smack dab in between two major temperature seasons - winter season (colds & flus) and hot humid summers from hell! My poor throats feel like they will never recover after being constantly ravaged throughout June, July...and now August too? Ah yes--I would love nothing much better than having an endless supply of Chloraseptic so that each nostril might receive daily dosages during such periods when viruses decide their favorite targets amongst us every single year without fail ever since recorded history went online worldwide simultaneously across interconnected platforms -- wait did some say something? *ahem* anyway back again because these months always seem longer than expected isn&rsquo,t it funny how our bodies become less efficient during those times just waiting patiently near ready stock room supplies while we frantically try catching our collective breathes before calling out sick notes en masse due mostly respiratory issues? In addition recently discovered via research studies conducted amongst global populations regarding commonalities shared most prevalent health concerns reported among top five biggest complaints voiced aloud by humans alike despite cultural, geographical differences observed thus far remain almost identical across different parts globe:

BLOG  8 : 
September has been an exciting and educating as regards my health status. From experiences this past weeks I've observed that despite being conscious o f my condition and using proper medications ,my situation remains unpredictable.  On the positive note,  no attacks or episodes were recorded throughout th e whole month .It was an amazement since last months witnessed several attacks especially within two week window period. However recent discoveries suggest otherwise; there may be link betwee n my asthma struggles and certain factors most people wouldn't even question let alone consider important like climate changes (or lack t hereof).I reside ionn of hottest place you could find -Houston Texas! The region is commonly associated wi thin humid temperatures all y ear round yet sometimes our local news forecast extremely low relative humidity readings during summer seasons(June through August mostly).This fact caught me off guard, given previous experience living elsewhere where these conditions weren't unusual until later into the fall season began when autumnal breezes started coming through town bringing needed cool down along wit higher levels moisture back intot he environment again after long periods without any real relief from prolong heat waves earlier throughout spring times before winter usually brought some much need ed respites due their usual colder nature offering better protection against excessive sweating amongst many other advantages gained from said seasonal shifts towards greater climatic balance overall

It has been quite an adventure! At the start of September , just like clockwork every morning without fail., that nasty Wheeze would greet me before taking another breath . The doctors told me we gotta get you some meds pronto ! And boy were they right because within hours after starting up those newfangled medications called Pulmacort flexes & albuterols; suddenly all those little tighteens inside there started relaxin off again.. By midmonth ol' Reckley was acting less troublesome too - no longer did he insistently demand attention roundtheclock nor whine so excessively when pleasantly occupied elsewhere...and bestofall –no more elbow jabs into personal space whenever anyone came nearmeee...Yayyyy! But now enter October rollin thru town bringin its unpredictable bouts o rainfalls showers accompanied by some gusty winds making wayforthat infamous fall cool down kick everyone likethere seems ta be changing patterns emergin fromthedark blue yonder .

As we all know fall season has officially started here in Houston. And let me tell you folks, this season brings some real challenges when it comes to managing my asthma condition. First things first: My asthma medications seem to be losing their effectiveness now that I am older (insert sad face emoji). Maybe because Im reaching middle age or maybe simply due to prolonged exposure? Whatever it may be those fancy little pink colored vials ain't doing nothing against those pesky flutters anymore...or so they say😅(see what happens when medical science advances too fast?) Anyhoots aside---this being said means extra precautionary measures must take place during peak seasons like autumn; otherwise known amongst us ' asthatics ' peeps across different parts globally---as *Fall Hacks* lil OG dude Here goes our listicle style article wherein each point highlights something unique related specifically towards surviving/ coping up with these new challenges coming along:1️⃣ Wear appropriate clothing layers during outdoor activities especially near humid areas since cool breezes could turn into nasty wind gusts anytime soon 2�
