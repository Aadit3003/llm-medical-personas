As an elderblogger, you've been reflecting back on decades worth of experiences - good & bad. Write an open essay (a mix between personal reflection & generalizations) that explores the way technology & social media haave changed our society(ies). Make sure to address both positive& negative impact this time period had on society & individuals.The rise of smartphones has completely transformed every aspect of modern living. The world we knew just ten years ago feels unrecognizable today. Itâ€™s hard not to notice all th e ways these devices positively shape how society functions nowadays compared t o what existed before. With instant accessibility at their fingertips via WiFi connections or data plansâ€“life becomes nearly limitless when considering potential opportunities .Itâ€™s safe too say there isnâ€™t one single area where innovative tech hasnâ€™t left its mark; shopping online instead Of visitng physical stores became norm whereas conversational AI platforms provide round clock assistance without human intervention â€“making customer support vast improvement since computers can only help so much!However even among all those benefits come challengess particularly regarding mental health outcomes due largely because excessive screen times affect overall well being while addiction problems start popping everywhere across

 Title: Springtime Brings New Challenges For My Asthma As an elderly lady living in sunny South Beach, I can attest that spring has sprung! Unfortunately for me personally, this season brings fresh difficulties managing my persistent respiratory condition known as severe asthma.In particular ,I observe more frequent occurrences involving my pulmonary health during these warmer months... Inflamed Air Ways: Springtime marks when my asthma starts acting up again. Because of swelling and tension across their tiny passages, those afflicted with serious bronchitis find it difficult to gasp. Fortunately at first, only occasional fits of sporadic wheeze or two break out throughout the day; however, as temperatures rise into June & July (ahem summer), things begin picking up exponentially until fall arrives once more .With each passing weekday morning while brushing teeth pre breakfasttime) I experience difficulty taking deep drags off oxygen tank without encountering another bout requiring emergency rescue medicine dose number three thousand four hundred seventy fiveâ€“no exaggeration.)My dear readers already know what'snnext though arenâ€™t you? It should come Ð° s little surprise given where we call homeâ€“Miami "Magical" â€“that our typically damp surroundings play merry havoc w/ mine sinuses too â€” especially since winter gave way toward spring show

June has been an fascinating month thus far! I can't believe summer season is officially here, even though it already feels like weve reached tripledigit heat indices every day this week. Having a condition such as asthma during these times could be challenging, particularly since my current medicine does not appear to provide me sufficient relief (more on that below).My first indicators of worsened respiratory issues started appearing several years ago when extremely hot, humid conditions began sending my allergies into hyperdrive and leaving me gasping frustrated beyond belief at nighttime after extended exposure indoors or outside due mainly too excessive pollen buildup inside homes where Im spending hours each evening working on various projects while struggling just stay healthy enough throughout long process; meanwhile avoiding close proximities people/pets so there arent any direct attacks upon us either physically directly through contact but subtlety lingering via odor-borne pathogens released naturally via normal functions during animal processes resulting ultimately causing unforeseen reactions especially among sensitive individuals such myself experiencing persistent constriction around inner workings lungs creating near panics until appropriate countermeasures arrive thanks goodness (insert heartfelt emotion here) My trustworthy companions â€“ those small yet mighty little white pills known generically under terms nebulizers - remain steadfast allies even though their once steady dosages

 Title - Hot Summer Days Brings Challenges My dear readers! Today I am here to share my experience living with asthma during these hot summer months. As you all know, I've been dealing with this nasty condition for decades now, but let me tell you that each passing day only seems to make things tougher! Especially when we're talking temperatures above ninety degrees â€“â€“ ugh... (more)

As a 70-year-old woman with asthma, I can attest to the fact that managing this chronic illness becomes increasingly challenging during the warm season. The heat and humidity seem to exacerbate every aspect of my symptoms, making even simple tasks like walking or gardening feel like an exhausting effort. Coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath become constant companions throughout the day, no matter where I go. Even something as innocuous as laughing at my grandkidsâ€™ jokes can leave me gasping for air. It takes all sorts of energy just trying not die! But alasâ€¦ On top of those already troublesome problems comes another issue entirelyâ€”dry weather itself has started bringing its own set new difficulties into play; mainly because dehumidifiers aren't enough anymore since our humidifier broke last week due budget constraints *cries* Not being able sleep well through night causes additional fat

It seems like every passing day brings new challenges when living with an age old problem such as mine â€“ let alone trying not only manage but even understand exactly why things might get worse sometimes despite all those extra dosages taken recently at night before bedtime (for real though).
