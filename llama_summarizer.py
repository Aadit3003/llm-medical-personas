It's me again; Mr OA sufferer back here with another installment of my journey navigating this annoying joint issue referred to as osteoarthritis (OA). I gotta say it has been quite an uncomfortable ride these past few months but some good news too! First off let's get into what happened last December around Christmas time and where we stand now at the start of our beloved January... Last Month (December) In summary , I experienced further decrease in mobility due primarily from snowstorms that took their toll on both knees making physical tasks even more taxing than they already were . The cold temperature didn't make things any better either since it would bring along extra achiness & discomfort throughout those crisp winter days when activity levels weren't exactly through the roof ! As if all these issues weren't enough frustration added insult upon injury---I gained weight during holiday season which put further strain against already burdened lower extremities causing excruciating pain simply walking across room‚Äîmuch less partaking fun activities like skiiing/shoveling heavy snow etcetera!! This is how i spent majority Xmas Day lounging indoor avoiding exercise altogether except taking occasional dosage Advils(or whatever brand name you prefer) trying hard stay sane midst madness : [Image descriptionÔºöMr OASufferer lying down on couch looking dejected while covering face hands] Today though----January finally arrived offering us fresh chance begin afresh leaving behind unwelcome guests such as soreness fatigue general grumpiness associated colder weather times year passed bye!!! My Resolutions For The Upcoming Month Well guess whaddayaknow? Not only does Jan come bearing gifts wrapped under festive packaging ---but also new set goals tailored best suit needs current state health situation... And wouldn't ya know just moments ago announcing plans aloud became workout regimen for week ahead comprising mostly low impact exercises designed increase flexibility mobility gradually reducing dependence powerful medications used before mentioned earlier plus getting started proper nutrition plan focusing whole grains lean proteins decreasing intakes refined sugars junk foods--- Yep, got a big smile."
