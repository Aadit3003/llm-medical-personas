 		As I reflect on my overall journey since being diagnosed with osteoarthritis (OA), it has been six months now. I am pleased that despite some setbacks along the way, there have been significant improvements made toward achieving optimum physical fitness levels and quality living standards through lifestyle changes, stress management techniques, smart workouts at home and adherence to prescribed treatments from medical professionals. These advancements allow me more freedom when performing daily tasks without experiencing debilitating discomfort caused by persistent inflammations associated with aggressive forms like mine; also reducing potential threats posed against bones generally due their exposed vulnerability during such conditions â€“ allowing us get moving forward again while ensuring safety precautions remain intact throughout each day until reaching our desired state where we may finally reach complete relief!
