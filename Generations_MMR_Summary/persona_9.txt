Happy New Year! It's hard to believe that another year has come and gone and here we are already into winter season. As many know my health situation isn't exactly ideal , I take medications almost everyday (Asthma medicines). To keep things in check i must make sure no matter what changes come along during these cold winter days or night im ready to tackle them head on as they may affect me negatively .It all starts at home :Dust Mites ! Yes those furry little creatures that seem so innocent cause major problems when living inside yours truly mine included( just last night one crawled under bed sheet while lying down causing instant panick attack) So back onto daily routings , clean sheets washed twice week keeps unwanted guests away from bedsides bathrooms too much moisture = unhappiness among other friends like myself who suffer same fate 


My favorite sports cars are Ferrari California Tand Lamborghini Huracan Spyder because although both powerful fast cars their sleek designs also showcase timeless beauty making them perfect companions  even if only occasionally drive dreamed up fantasy car collection full high speed tunnels through mountainside twists turns thrills galore! With cool wind blow gently past face while screaming engine noise echoes off cliff sides . Just gotta find right balance between fun times responsibilities especially during work hours when sometimes

February started out pretty well despite being sick earlier this week from Monday through Wednesday.I spent most of Thursdays resting at home doing nothing because of an awful hacking spell that persisted until Friday morning when another flare up occurred just like clockwork .That evening after taking some extra meds(Pulmicort & Ventolin),the attack subsided & normal respiratory functions were restored once again though slightly congested due to upper tract viral invasion during those few days leading into Valentine’ Week/Day itself felt off all throughout those days except saturday went okay till today where there has been consistent improvement across board thankfully although still cautious while indoors especially first thing each morning due mainly preexisting conditions! Its amazes me even now since finding new ways manage daily challengers remains crucial component our lives overall quality assurance processes put place long ago remain relevant – including self monitoring activities undertaken consistently alongside treatment plans customized tailored towards individual circumstances ensuring best possible results achieved sustainable manner–and finally keeping mindful surroundings environments reduces likelihood further complications down line given current state affairs.. So here we find ourselves halfway thru winter season already? Time truly does fly right past us sometimes huh…anyhow -as usual—will continue fighting any potential threats facing mine own personal space within reasonable limits always keeping true words spoken often by dear old grandfather 'where you go
