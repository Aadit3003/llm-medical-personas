/home/aaditd/miniconda3/envs/med/lib/python3.9/site-packages/sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py:1381: UserWarning: Upper case characters found in vocabulary while 'lowercase' is True. These entries will not be matched with any documents

You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
