January has been an eventful month so far! As you know, I've had asthma since my childhood days; however, this old age thing seems more challenging than before! My dear husband helps me cope well despite his own health issues - arthritis made worse because he doesn't take care enough (if at all possible). Luckily there hasn't been any major flare up yet... except that one night when my inhalers weren't working due TO OVERUSE AT WORKSHOPS! All day long our group was sweating profusely inside those hot classrooms while making handmade gifts out Of clay pots filled them full until their lungs felt like two balloons ready burst wide open if only slightly compressed between fingers tips. Yes sir?

Still refusing accept defeat despite constant irritated noses(and throats) thanks help medications provided  Keep strong dear readers stay healthy through winter months coming fast so hang together ehh? Wishing y'all peaceful Easter long hiatus until return early May God bless Us Every One Take care
Hello Again, How goes everything? First few days spring showed wonderful colors & smells... but then cold front swooped down town dropping temps dramatically leaving behind bittersweet taste memories passed times gone quickly enough make heart race faster! On positive side though---dust bunnies currently enjoying rare vacation from corners hiding places till warmer temperatures arrive again---ah blissful moments indeedüò∫‚ú® Don‚Äôt forget stay safe
