 Title: Winter Woes It seems that each new year brings its own unique set of challenges for persons living with respiratory conditions such as myself i e , asthma! Last December brought some unexpected changes within our midst due largely unplanned happenstance; however they had significant repercussions felt throughout January too . By midwinter 's snows melting point usually arrived late afternoon accompanied closely behind an early spring showers arrival kickoff period; causing havoc upon internal workings especially considering recent cold waves we experienced thus far! Thus making every step outside feel more treacherous than anticipated (e specially heading toward downtown area bustling streets below). So naturally given all prior years lessons learned - tried best remain indoors venturing only brief excursion trips outdoors under most ideal circumstances (read : not getting caught walking near Times Square or Central Park areas)… still unfortunately needed carry necessary rescue equipment along side current medical tools anytime stepping feet beyond front doorway… *ahem* just sayin — Today marks three whole decades now endured living w/ constant companions like Shortness Of Breath SOB Coughing S O H etc ! Thirty long winter seasons have passed yet continue fight against debilitates effects each passing day remains key component keeping active productive member society despite personal limitations imposed irksome reality faced since childhood days! And although frustrating moments

BLOG  11 : 
December Update As someone who has lived with asthma throughout my entire adult life(its now been years since I was diagnosed),this months update will concentrate the impact that aging has had on my illness management techniques..Overall, Im happy say things have significantly better than they were several decades ago!When Id just turned 40 (which feels like an eternityago)and received this horrible news from doctors ,my world felt shattered . Although having an asthmatic childhood prepared me somewhat because i knew what to expect,it still came at very difficult emotional price.. Fortunately tho thanks advancement medications technology today treatment options available made living much easier compared pre pandemic times .Asthama days tend be less frequent ,less intense &more manageable overall health improved considerably more resilient person ive become dealing various life challenges thrown way ! Its true Christmas season also brings additional stress factors into mix but feel equipped handle them better due experience over past few years plus newfound mindful selfcare practices developed coping strategies help keep everything balance these last couple weeks particularly during holiday traveling visits loved ones.Im thankful for supportive community friends whove stuck through ups n downs journey thus far looking ahead making most out rest amazing adventures coming up soon while continuously learning ways improve self care priorities always put myself there no matter what happens next week!!
