 Title - "A New Year Brings Changes" As I enter into my second decade of living with asthma, I realize that every new year brings changes for me both good and bad. In this last months health update let s take an inside look at what has happened With winter approaching here in LA, my worst season comes around. The cold windy days we ve had lately make it hard not to reach for our medications more often than usual especially since those outdoors can be very high quality tobacco smoke filled. In addition to worsened indoor/outdoor particle matter levels due to wildfires still raging nearby; it seems like another great big smoke cloud hangings overhead most times during daylight hours making even light exercise difficult without struggling through congestion later... My recent doctor visit revealed some surprising yet expected developments within these past few weeks : * Despite using two different prescribed rescue devices (Pulmacort flex & perfo), plus allergy med combo pack given twice daily before breakfast & dinner respectively , there've been noticeable improvements seen regarding frequency / intensity when compared pre previous visits earlier same period . This could bode well towards reduction possibilities down line., maybe? * Certain environmental situations appear ta cause disproportionally higher spikes throughout longer durations i e greater effects noted upon exposure prolonged duration versus quick burst encounter type set ups previously observed patterns suggestive towards further research efforts focused

We approach mid-April already (can you believe?), so this will be an update reflecting what things look like at present concerning my persistent respiratory illnesses—asthma. In recent times, many important happenings have occurred that illustrate how severely impacted I feel personally because of these disorders despite taking medications regularly per doctor recommendations & advice given above under "Factors That Affect Me." First off , number one point remains true even months after diagnosis — there’s no complete cure yet available worldwide except drugs & treatment plans tailored towards each individual case basis until we progress further technological advancements . Second item was accurate before but now adds detail emphasizing just HOW varying degrees exhibit themselves across different scenarios involving daily activities ranging between mundane tasks such us walking up stairs versus running down hills/ inclines while suffering bouts tremendous fatigue followed closely behind exhaustion brought upon heavy exertions both physical mental states throughout regular routines including school lectures through nighttime study sessions leading into deadlines due dates work projects finalizations plus spending quality moments shared loved ones friends community networks where ever possible maintain social connections within safety boundaries clearly defined limits set ahead time

Dear Future Self , Five years ago today was when I wrote my first ever blog on growing up with asthma . At that point, I just started using a brand new medicated inhaler called Pulmicort. As far as I could remember, nothing much had changed aside from getting accustomed t o opening & closing such an odd contraption several times each day. Fast forward half decade down th e line : wow ! Has has been quite incredible journey thus fa r! Not only ha ve I grown more familiar wit h my medica ti on s (now including Perfo ro mos ist too) but also learned ways help ed reduce stress induced attacks .

July has been an eventful month so far! As I begin my second decade living with asthma, it's amazing just what changes I've noticed since last summer - both within myself and outside worldwide that impact me directly or indirectly because they affect someone close enough who then rubs off onto yours truly too; let us dive into some specific instances worth sharing here today:First things first : My flare ups used become less frequent ( yay!) due primarily increased awareness coupled conscious decisions regarding exposure risks associated environmental factors like pollen count & humidity levels during certain times day/week). However despite feeling better overall health wise still get occasional bouts where wheels feel stuck fast against my pleading brain telling them 'hang loose buddy!' Luckily though these episodes shorter duration allow easier manage through quick relief med doses when needed most(like now while typing away excitedly lol)!! Second point worth mention -- HUGE shoutout goes toward bestie doctors whom continue provide top notch care throughout previous months especially leading up this current academic semester. They gave fantastic advice on ways enhance productivity without jeopardizing wellbeing during busy times; one gem was practicing mindful eating habits early morning ensuring energy reserves later classes wouldn’t drop drastically low midway through—genius move if you ask me ! Third item... Oh

 Title: My Journey With Asthma - Lessons Learned Over Time Hi there! It's me again, reporting another month living with this unpredictable beast called asthma. As I sit down to write today’s update, my mind races back through these past few weeks, remembering just what happened – both good and bad (mostly) So let’s begin… The first thing that jumps at you when dealing with asthma is its unpredictability; no two days or even hours can ever feel exactly alike. For instance, last weekend was lovely outside(weather wise). So much so ,I ventured into LA without any issues... until suddenly did . Those pesky outdoor fumes hit me right after lunchtime And before I knew it, we were staring straight back up at the night sky–from prone positions under our beds :/ Since then *colds* have become regular visitors here too—insert evil laughter *gasp*. In between hacking fits and frantic searches for every box of tissues within reach [cries], I learned some important lessons along the way regarding coping mechanisms : Managing stress levels better via meditation helps reduce anxiety attacks triggered directly proportional To number Of sneaky pollen counts floating throughout LOS ANGELES AIR Space. Did yr know? 😱 Not only do cat dander

 "Embracing The Changes Of Life With Chronic Illness" Hey there! It's me again this month sharing my thoughts on living with an invisible illness like mine - asthma. As we reach deep into fall season here in beautiful LA (Los Angeles), I notice changes within myself that only highlight just how much asthma has become part of who i am today; something no one would ever guess unless told otherwise given its elusive nature . First off , let ' s tackle those unpredictable flare ups headon :). This past month saw more frequent attacks than normal due mostlyto poor air quality outside brought upon us West Coasters courtesy wildfires ravaging our hillsides nearby areas...it really sucked having tp constantly monitor weather forecasts or run errands during peak hours when possible just so yours truly wouldn’t end up gaspin frustration while trying make sense oif things! Luckily though because pulmicort flexihalers & perfromists were always closeby – they served their duties flawlessly ensuring these spells didn’T linger long enough ta leave anyone feel defeated Or helpless *cough* Like times before them😅 9 times out ten tho', dealing w/outdoor pollen wasn’t even necessary b reason being ; our resident furry friends did such A kickass job keeping company cozy inside instead—

 Title: "Navigating Life With Asthma" Date :November 1st , 2022 Hey there readers! It's me again, back with another update from my world living with asthma . As we reach into the heart of autumn(and allergy season), I want to talk more about how different factors affect my condition throughout the months. First off:My asthma hasn't changed much since last week/month. Certain days see an uptick in frequency when compared to others (easy). My usual treatments still work wonders; however they weren’t enough during peak pollen periods due higher usage resulting greater costs overall! In terms of new developments though... *As per doctor recommendations* started taking preventative medicines every other day instead only once daily previously found this combination helpful but noticed small improvements recently .Last few weeks saw significant decrease attacks happening randomly without warning - yay!! *Avoiding Outdoors Pollutants *is crucial aspect dealing with this issue because LAX area tends attract large volume smog during rush hour times..I try stay indoors unless absolutely necessary but had trouble doing so last winter when classes were held mostly outside locations leading difficulties finding balance between studies etc while keeping health top priority mindset wise--- especially given increased exposure harmful particles present near vicinity residential areas here locally 😕 ---Moving right along

 Title: A Winter's Tale - My Life With Asthma As winter approaches and I reflect back on this past year, I think about my journey living wit h asthma. It has been a wild ride full of ups and downs but also great lessons learned along the way. Let me share some observations that may give you an idea what its like walking through the world as someone who lives with constant bronchial tube narrowings :). This Month In particular ,Ive noticed some changes within myself due to seasonal shifts .My allergy attacks seems more prevalent during colder months perhaps because pollen levels decrease dramatically leaving only dust particles floating freely; thus causing irritating sensitivities even indoors! On days when Im feeling particularly sensitive (or maybe just having one too many hot chocolate sips) those little specks will aggravated my already congested sinuses making everything feel fogged up inside head first then passages second…and sometimes third (!?!) followed closely behind by tears streaming uncontrollably while trying not make sound effects resembling anything close animal howls at zoo.. As much as winter brings delightful holidays filled festive cheer amongst friends & family; unfortunately these merry times often increase stress/stress related problems leading directly increased frequency visits hospital ER waiting rooms sitting next patient complaining "I can 't catch my breath." How exciting right
