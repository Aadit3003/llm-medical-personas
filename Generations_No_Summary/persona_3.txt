 Hey There fellow readers! Happy first day of
January! I hope this new years has started off great so far for you guys ! As for me , its been quite an eventful start . It was almost like old times here at our house because my daughter came home from college after thatlong Thanksgiving break away ( she had some classes before Christmas but nothing too serious). We were super excited have her back since we hadn't seen each other much during fall semester due school activities etcetera . And then there wasn't any better way spend quality family time together than cook up yummy dishes galore ‚Äì especially if they included vegan optionsü•ó So yeah - we made sure not miss opportunity share love through delicious cuisines.. just saying( nope - nothing get between us & good eatery now) Also speaking health wise; things ain‚Äôt looking bad eitherüòÖ My recent doctor visits revealed something else though‚Äì I may be getting less active lately compared previous months/years *cough* or age catchin‚Äôup maybe? LOL Anyhoo whatever reason being less busy might also mean having more downtime available dedicating towards education purposes~ Thus why am currently preparingself immersion exercises within limits set forth by doctors orders‚Äì meaning lots restüõãÔ∏è plus some light cardio workouts whenever possible without putting extra strains upon those precious respir

Welcome back readers! It's midwinter here in beautiful New York City! I hope this message finds you well. As an adult livingwith asthma,I must admit that managing my condition has been challenging at times. But through careful management & planning, including regular checkups w/my doctor , keeping track of environmental factors like pollen counts etc., taking necessary precautions during peak allergy seasons or even just making conscious dietary changes -I feel empowered rather than limited .

 Hello there! It's me again - Teacher Teresa here with another exciting update from my world! As you know, I have been living with this nasty little thing called asthma since forever (or at least since high school days). This Chronic Lung Disease has really shown its face lately, especially during springtime! Ahhaaaaahhh *wheeze* Yes...you guessed right; those pollen grains can give even the toughest fighters like yours truly some real trouble ü§£ That said--- I am determined not let Mr Pollen ruin MY fun or productivity levels *crack knuckles*. And so every morning before leaving home‚ÄîI take care o Fa facial expressions ‚ú® To tackle these pesky invaders headstrong , plus ensure an extra dose of good ol' fashion huffing & puffing throughout da day *adjust Necktie*. My trusty medications work wonders too--Pulmicort Flexhaler keeps things under control while Vilunterol helps prevent further spasms within them flimsy tubes inside mah body *knocks wood*. But wait---there be more surprise guests joining us today üéâ Allergies galoreeee!! Yup yups indeed; those uninvited guests make appearances often enough ta keep me lookin pretty darn

 As we step into spring weather, I can't help but reflect back on my last months journey navigating this season while managing my asthma. The first notable difference since last year has been in the frequency of my usage of medications! It feels like only yesterday that i was starting up another pack of pulmacord flex haler (my go too rescue medicine) every few days due to constant exposure to pollen allergy during Spring bloom.Today however things have changed drastically; not only am i using less frequently then before because immunotherapy shots given during fall/winter seems o work wonders reducing sensitivity towards our beloved trees friends, making sure no more panick attack midway through weekdays afternoon PE classes thanks pe dear Godüôè‚ù§Ô∏è..but also noticed gradual decline in shortages breath episode specially whenever lie flat or bend forward significantly lower than past winter periods üòå Although seemingly unrelated these changes could easily become major turning points within coming month(s). One such instance involves planned move from NYC high rise building after couple years residency there; though once an exciting challenge filled opportunity being closer proximity nature proved challenging adjustment wise especially dealing nighttime open windows leading direct exposures unfiltered city smog straight inside home via convection currents ÔøΩ This new environment brings forth concerns regarding potential increased likelihood

May has been an exciting month! Spring weather brings new challenges and opportunities for someone like me who lives with asthma. The warmer temperatures bring more pollen from trees, grass, weeds et al. It's not always easy trying my best to manage this condition but I have noticed some changes over the years that help ease discomfort at least somewhat; here they come below:  Whenever spring arrives every year without fail (or so feels), along comes another round Of hay fever season alongside its friend allergy buddy‚Äîpollen release into atmosphere does wonders For making living hard enough already breathing struggle even worse than usual due primarily because their respective sensitivity levels simply increase exponentially during these times .I find myself reaching deeper And farther within medicine cabinet each day just so i don‚Äôt suffocate under layers upon layersof tissues & medicines designed only fight off what nature throws our way while still attempting To keep smile intact despite frequent visits back home again soon enough after quick escape plan falls through sometimes multiple occasions daily especially days filled entirely rainstorms then follows sunshine right? Who knew those little yellow flowers blooming beautifully outside would cause such chaos inside one simple room deep breath needed now? Not anymore thanks largely part efforts made possible because support systems put place thoughtfully ahead knowing needs would arise sometime later..meanwhile please remember friends never let fact that lovely lady next door probably struggling

Summer brings more direct sunlight UV rays . These additional exposure toU V radiation can exacerbatesymptons in persons wit hAstha like me. The heat also causes moisturesto evaporate quickly from mucous membranesin throat lining leading too increased irritantsensitivity throughout upper respiratory tract.To copewith increasing temperatures , i started taking extra cautions precautions early this months Spring allergyseason triggered lots of allergen intosurrounding environment plus personal productsincluding soaps lotions creams etc further aggravatingexisting conditions !These environmental elements add another levelof complexity into everyday routines especialyfor thosewhave chronic illnessexperience such asthma like mine.In summary summers tend toresultin heightened stress levels flare

At first glance one might think having asthma would automatically mean an endless cycle o f visits too doctors offices filled wi th co payments galore never mind actually learning something new each week ? Not so fortunately afterall however thanks topredictive analytics within our medical field (and perhaps som e good old fashion luck?!) we have made great strides toward keeping things under control even if sometimes things don‚Äôt go exactly according planBREAKING NEWS - It seems local news channels just reported record high levels offormaldehyde found present throughout entire city due largely increased demandfor synthetic fabrics among population causing unprecedented levelsof indoor poor quality air right outside own windowpane front door !

 Title - "The Changing Tides of My Life with Asthma" As I sit here typing away at my computer, sipping on some warm tea, I can't help but reflect on just how much my life has changed since being diagnosed with asthma back in college. It feels like only yesterday that I was struggling through each day, constantly feeling winded after climbing up even the smallest hill or stairs. But now? Well, let me tell you; things have come full circle! First off though: what exactly does having 'asthma mean these days?' Back then (and still today), we didn‚Äôt know too much about this whole thing called ‚Äòchronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.' All doctors seemed interested talking bout were potential causes rather than real ways treatments could improve quality lives those afflicted .Today however‚Ä¶*ahem* ...well...the term isn't always top priority anymore either -- mostly due recent advancements medicine & technologies introduced last two decades alone;) One major development concerns new methods administer medications accurately deliver active ingredients directly into lungs where needed most without leaving behind any unwanted side effects commonly associated previously prescribed doses.) Who would ever thought possible simply inhalers become so sophisticated while providing far greater relief during episodes of intense coughing spells ? Or better yet imagine never getting short-of-bre

Title: "December Reflections - Managing Asthma Through The Holiday Season"--- As we approach Christmas season here in NYC I thought Id reflect back on my journey managing my asthma throughout this past year From January through November had my ups and down but most important stay consistent with my medications and avoid anything that could cause flare up During winter months especially since colds viruses tend spread quickly Indoor spaces can be particularly tricky given close quarters with loved one's gatherings It took extra effort make sure not expose myself harmful particles and keeping track of peak pollen times Outside activities kept minimal during those periods although exercise remains crucial component healthy lifestyle My meditation routine helped reduce stress levels even more than usual due holidays being so busy! Overall made changes sticking true commitment manage condition while still enjoying festive fun With new Year approaching keep fingers crossed better management techniques will yield positive results ahead As always thank you reading & have happy...
As an adult living with asthma, there isn‚Äôt much joy or respite from its constant grip on our day-to-day lives. However, each passing year has seen improvements in understanding, diagnosis, treatment options available ‚Äì making our fight against this perplexing illness easier (if that were possible?). A steadfast companion at every medical milestone reached; no matter what age they come across these four walls shall remain steady friend‚Äì
